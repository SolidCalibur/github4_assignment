1. visit the following server http://165.227.88.53 and download the page there 
   you can use wget to download the page

2. research and figure out a tool that you will use to transfer this downloaded page from your windows machine to your linux machine

3. Set up an apache web server to deploy that downloaded page

4. Set up and apache tomcat server 
   and then go to the below website and download the war file "it will be under the link (here) "
   https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/

5. finally create a filesystem called /mickey_mouse
   let this filesystem have a size of 800mb
   within this file system there should be a sub directory called mansion
   let the mansion directory be owned by a user called dab
   and finally share this directory as read only to another server which you will also create


Good luck
